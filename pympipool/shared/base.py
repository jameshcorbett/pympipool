    The pympipool.Executor behaves like the concurrent.futures.Executor but it uses mpi4py to execute parallel tasks.
    In contrast to the mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor the pympipool.Executor can be executed in a serial python process
    and does not require the python script to be executed with MPI. Still internally the pympipool.Executor uses the
    mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor, consequently it is primarily an abstraction of its functionality to improve the
    usability in particular when used in combination with Jupyter notebooks.

    Args:
        cores (int): defines the number of MPI ranks to use for each function call
        threads_per_core (int): number of OpenMP threads to be used for each function call
        gpus_per_task (int): number of GPUs per MPI rank - defaults to 0
        init_function (None): optional function to preset arguments for functions which are submitted later
        cwd (str/None): current working directory where the parallel python task is executed

    Examples:
        ```
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from pympipool.shared.base import SingleTaskExecutor
        >>>
        >>> def calc(i, j, k):

        >>>     rank = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()
        >>>     return np.array([i, j, k]), size, rank
        >>>
        >>> def init_k():
        >>>     return {"k": 3}
